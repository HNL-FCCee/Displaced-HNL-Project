# HNL Project

Welcome to the HNL Project git page.
How do you use it?
It is markdown (see the extension of this file, '.md'), you can learn a bit more on what markdown can do, you can check the [GitHub markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Since it is for documentation, no need for branches.
You can edit directly in the browser using the pencil:

![Pencil blue](pencil.png?raw=true "Pencil in blue")

Or you can copy the repository to a folder in your computer or the lxplus using the following commands:

# First time:

```git clone https://github.com/HNL-FCCee/Displaced-HNL-Project ```
```cd Displaced-HNL-Project```
